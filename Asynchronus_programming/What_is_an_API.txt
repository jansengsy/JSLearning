/*
  What is an API? An Application programming interface. This is a very broad term, but think of it like a 
  contract between one piece of software to another. Made up of structured request and structured responses.

  When we say API in JS, we generally mean web APIs. 
  
  The most common of which is REST: Representational State Transfer.

  REST relies on stateless client server protocols (almost always HTTP)

  The most common types of requests are:

  GET: Retrieve data from a resource

  POST: Submit data to be processed to a resource

  PUT: Update a specified resource

  UPDATE: Delete a specified resource

  APIs use things called "endpoints", which in the web are URLs that you access to do certain things, for example@

  GET: https://someurl.com/api/users
  DELETE: https://someurl/com/api/users/:id
