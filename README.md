Each folder pertains to a different section of learning. To use these examples install the live server plugin for VS code (or a similar plugin for non-vscode users).

Running an example:

- Run the index.html within the desired learning section folder with live server.
- Rename the JS file you want to use to 'app.js'
- Start editing and playing with the example code.
